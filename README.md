# Gerrymandering--Project
Python project that simulates fair redistricting using graph algorithms and census data.

This project uses Python and graph algorithms to create fair electoral districts by balancing population and keeping districts geographically connected. Each precinct is treated as a node in a graph, and districts are grown outward using a BFS-style approach.

The goal is to reduce gerrymandering by making districts more equal in population while maintaining realistic boundaries based on census data.
